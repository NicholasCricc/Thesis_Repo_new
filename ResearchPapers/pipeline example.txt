Pipeline:

Qgis phase
		Phase 1: Land classification map(colors) "made sure it is .tif file format"

		phase 2: Use Land classification map as a base to extract contours to get height map that can be imported to unity as .raw file format
		
		phase 3: Plugin was used to to make it a perfect square.
	


Unity phase:
		phase 1: Import Land classification map in to unity as texture 2d
	
		phase 2: create a blank terrain and import the raw data.

		phase 3: Change region names and color accordingly to there classifications of malta areas.	


Blender phase:
		phase 1: Find appropriate textures for the different asset regions.

		phase 2: create the assets based on the regions in unity.

		phase 3: attach textures to the models created.

		phase 4: Export models as .fbx to unity after exporting drag and drop the models to the appropriate regions.
