Unity 3D Thesis Project - "MaltaExplorer"
Overview
"MaltaExplorer" is a comprehensive Unity 3D thesis project that transforms satellite imagery data from the Copernicus Hub into a detailed and interactive 3D map of Malta. 
The project involves the division of Malta into sections, each color-coded to represent different areas such as forests, croplands, and buildings. 
The data is extracted from satellite images, modified, and imported into Unity as a 2D texture. Through procedural coding, the texture is then utilized to dynamically add assets, creating a 3D representation of Malta with detailed environmental features.

Features
Utilizes satellite imagery data from the Copernicus Hub.
Color-codes different sections of Malta based on land use (forests, croplands, buildings, etc.).
Imports and processes the satellite image as a 2D texture in Unity.
Procedurally generates a 3D map of Malta with accurate environmental details.
Dynamic asset placement based on the color-coded sections.

How It Works
Satellite imagery data from the Copernicus Hub is obtained.
The data is modified and color-coded to represent distinct land-use categories.
The color-coded map is imported into Unity as a 2D texture.
Through procedural coding, the texture is analyzed, and assets are dynamically placed in the 3D scene based on the color-coded sections.
The result is an interactive 3D map of Malta, providing a visual representation of different environmental features.

Development Environment
